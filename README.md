This is the code for a group project I participated in which was all about classification.  For our Dataset we chose to work with the OkCupid dataset used in the [paper by Emil Kirkegaard.](https://openpsych.net/paper/46)  It's a very interesting dataset to work with, and certainly comes with some associated challanges.  I did a write up on the project on [my blog](http://kylemix.com/Dating-Data/) if reading more is your thing.  

If you are interested in reproducing the results or using the code as a jumping off point for your own exploration, you'll need to run two of the notebooks, **BuildDatabase.ipynb** and **DataMunging.ipynb** in that order.  That will provide you with the data conveniently stored in a sqLite database which makes the exploration a little easier.  

Additionally there is a flask app for playing around with the results.  
Dating site data is super interesting.
